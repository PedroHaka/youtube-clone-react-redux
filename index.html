<!-- React Thoughts

// The 'root' element (a '<div></div>') is the only element in 'index.html'. 
// This is what React looks for when compiling shit and doing it's stuff: things inside 
// 'index.html', more specifially, inside 'root' div.
// Also please make sure to note that 'root' is manipulated by 'index.jsx' and that
// 'App' Component is rendered by 'index.jsx' inside 'root' div. 

// The 'index.jsx' script is analogous to the 'index.html' file in the sense that it holds 
// together all parts of the application, but diferently, it is a script, not a html, so 
// you benefit from logic and computing power. 
// 'index.jsx' script renders only one element (component) which is 'App.jsx' Component.

//'App' has the whole of the application scripts (components) rendered inside of it. 
// Which passes to 'index.jsx', which passes to 'index.html'. 
// Keeping track of this flow is the first thing everyone learns in React. So learn it!

// Think of 'App.jsx' as a white blackboard screen, where things render themselves into.
// Also think of 'index.jsx' as an event loop that keeps running and listening to whatever 
// 'App.jsx' means at any given time or state of the application. 
// And then it (re)renders itself inside 'root' div whenever the application is initialized,
// and also as state is manipulated throughout the dataflow of the App.
// Both htmls rendered and scripts that manipulate and re-render them are inside 'App.jsx'.
// All components are inside 'App.jsx'. Sauron would be jealous... or Mussolini.

// This keeps 'easy' (manageable) composing Complex Apps with lots of components, where is 
// always a root to come back to when things get too complicated (they will).
// In the end it looks like a tree (yay), the root being where other components are rendered 
// into, and individual components acting as semi-root parent components (having children
// components of their own, that could have children too, I mean, we are talking COMPLEX 
// APPLICATIONS... I expect this simple Youtube-clone component tree to look like I used 
// Treants for Christmas or smt).

// So keeping track of your steps is a 'bread-leftovers-left-on-woods-for-finding-a-way-back-home'
// kind of solution, but hey, it god-damn works. Just keep birds away (people messing in the 
// trails).
